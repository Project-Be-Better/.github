# Project-Be-Better

> A developer’s portfolio of continuous learning and practical exploration.

**Project-Be-Better** is a curated collection of hands-on learning challenges, personal projects, and technical experiments. It represents a long-term effort to grow as a developer by building intentionally, documenting clearly, and learning in public.

## Mission

To become a stronger, more thoughtful engineer by:

- Exploring new technologies through real projects  
- Documenting progress and insights for reference and reuse  
- Practicing clean design, iterative development, and DevOps fundamentals

## Highlight: 100 Days of Fullstack

A focused, day-by-day learning initiative to build full-stack proficiency through real-world projects. This includes backend, frontend, CI/CD, and cloud deployment with an emphasis on design quality and architecture.

Each module or milestone focuses on:

- Backend service development (Java Spring Boot, FastAPI, Node.js)
- Frontend apps using React, Vite, and Next.js
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, and Terraform
- RESTful API design and API gateway patterns
- Infrastructure setup and deployment on AWS (IAM, EC2, S3, Lambda)
